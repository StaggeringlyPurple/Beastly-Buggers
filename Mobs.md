### Mobs
The **Burdenbeetle** is a mob that you can find in the badlands.  Thanks to their tough shell, burdenbeetles deflect arrows and other projectiles.
Be careful when fighting them - They are extremly strong and tough.  When killed, they drop Beetle Horn Fragments and Carapace Segments.

**Buzzblades** are dragonfly-like creatures that are found in jungles.  Their spasmodic movement makes them tricky to kill, especially since they
dart towards you and damage you before you can react.  Not only that, but they spawn in large groups, making them truly formidable foes.  They
drop Juicy Bug Meat and Buzzblade Stinger Barbs.

In the desert, **Dunedashers** can spawn.  They are hostile versions of the Spider, and inflict you with Hunger IV for twenty seconds.

**Savannah Scuttlers** are another type of spider.  They are found in large groups in Savannah biomes.  They are verym irritating because they
can give you Poison II and Nausea II for twenty seconds.

In most cold biomes, **Snow Spiders** can spawn.  They inflict you with Weakness I for fifteen seconds and make you "freeze".  They drop Snowballs,
String, Spider Eyes, and Snow Spider Fangs.

When exploring Warped Forests, you have a chance to find a **Warperd Beetle**.  Small and fast, they are difficult to catch, but once you manage
to hit it, it will probably die due to it's low health.

**End Scorpion** can be found patrolling the outer End islands.  They rapidly fire several Scorpion Projectile Barbs out of their massive stingers
when they locate a player.  This makes it difficult to engage them in melee combat, but if you do, they also have a close-quaters attack in which
they snap their stingers.
