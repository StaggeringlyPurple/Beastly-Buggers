### Items
**Slingshots** can be crafted using three sticks in a "Y" shape with a piece of string in the middle.  You can use them to shoot **Slingshot Balls**, which come in four types: Heavy, Cold, Explosive, and Shrapnel-Shooting. **Heavy Balls** deal twenty-five damage (12.5 hearts)
when they hit an entity.  **Cold Balls** deal ten damage (5 hearts) but make the target Freeze for two minutes.  **Explosive Balls** deal no
extra damage, but explode with the force of two end crystals.  The explosions do _not_ destroy blocks, but _do_ damage entities.  **Shrapnel Balls** launch many small projectiles in all directions, great for area damage.


You can create a **Beetle Cleaver** by crafting a sword with Beetle Horn Fragments instead of a material and adding an extra Beetle Horn
Fragment off to the side.  It deals seventeen damage (8.5 hearts) on it's own, but can be enchanted with Sharpness (and other sword-applicable
enchantments).  If you have a Strength II potion and your Beetle Cleaver is enchanted with Sharpness V, you can deal THIRTY-SEVEN POINT FIVE damage (actually just 37 because you can't deal half a damage point) in one hit (I think my math is right :P). If you have Bane of Arthropods or Smite,
that number goes up even higher (when used on the correct mob).

A **Scorpion Whip** is a new combat weapon crafted with a Stick, String, and a Scorpion Projectile Barb.  It has the attack damage of a Diamond Sword and the attack speed of a Netherite Axe, but can reach entities from up to ten blocks away and pulls them towards you, great for preventing enemies from fleeing.

**Homing Arrows** are exactly what they sound like.  You shoot it out of a Bow or Crossbow, and it locates nearby hostile entities and players (not including the shooter) and steers itself towards them.  Craft them like an arrow but with a Buzzblade Stinger Barb instead of Flint and a Buzzblade Wing instead of a Feather.  [_name now changed to **Buzzblade Arrow**_]

**Juicy Bug Meat** is a new food item.  It is dropped by the mojority of the new mobs, and restores a single hunger point (half a drumstick icon) and practically no saturation.  It also gives you nausea.

You can cook Juicy Bug Meat on a Campfire to obtain **Crispy Bug Meat**.  It takes very little time to consume and restores four hunger points (two drumstick icons).

If you cook Juicy Bug Meat traditionally, like in a furnace or smoker, you will instead get **Charred Bug Meat**. It takes five seconds to consume (because it is so overcooked and tough and nasty) and gives you Hunger I for thirty seconds.

**Exoskeleton Armor** is a new armor set that is between Diamond and Netherite armor in terms of it's defense.  However, each piece of armor you put on decreases the chance that you get hit with a projectile. 
Instead, the projectile gets deflected and flung back where it came from.  It is crafted using Carapace Segemnts (dropped from Burdenbeetles) in the traditional crafting shapes.  Yes, you can use trims on it.

**Buzzblade Boosters** are used to propel you through the air in the direction you are facing.  Craft them with three Breeze Rods along the middle of a Crafting Table and four Buzzblade Wings, in the top corners and below them.

**Egg Sacs** are dropped by Snow Spiders and can also be found in Minecart Chests in Abandoned Mineshafts.  When shot from a Slingshot, they spawn 0-5 Cave Spiders.  If the projectile hits an entity, the cave spiders are all immediately hostile to that entity.  When crafted between two Bread vertically in the crafting table, they create **Egg-Sac-Sandwiches**, which apply the Saturation effect for two-and-a-half minutes.

The **Mineshaft Music Disc** has a small chance to be found in a Minecart Chest in Abandoned Mineshafts.  Special thanks to @T_en_M for the AWESOME music!

The mod also contains several items used solely for crafting: **Burdenbeetle Carapace Segments**, **End Scorpion Carapace Segments**, **Buzzblade Wings**, **Beetle Horn Fragments**, **Snow Spider Fangs**, **Buzzblade Stinger Barbs**, and **End Scorpion Projectile Barbs**.

There are a few more ingredient items, but they don't have any functionality yet so I'm not including them here.
