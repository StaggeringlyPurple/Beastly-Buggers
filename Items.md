### Items
**Slingshots** can be crafted using three sticks in a "Y" shape with a piece of string in the middle.  You can use them to shoot **Slingshot Balls**, which come in four types: Heavy, Cold, and Explosive. **Heavy Balls** deal twenty-five damage (12.5 hearts)
when they hit an entity.  **Cold Balls** deal ten damage (5 hearts) but make the target Freeze for two minutes.  **Explosive Balls** deal no
extra damage, but explode with the force of two end crystals.  The explosions do _not_ destroy blocks, but _do_ damage entities.

You can create a **Beetle Cleaver** by crafting a sword with Beetle Horn Fragments instead of a material and adding an extra Beetle Horn
Fragment off to the side.  It deals seventeen damage (8.5 hearts) on it's own, but can be enchanted with Sharpness (and other sword-applicable
enchantments).  If you have a Strength II potion and your Beetle Cleaver is enchanted with Sharpness V, you can deal THIRTY-SEVEN POINT FIVE damage (actually just 37 because you can't deal half a damage point) in one hit (I think my math is right :P). If you have Bane of Arthropods or Smite,
that number goes up even higher (when used on the correct mob).

A **Scorpion Whip** is a new combat weapon crafted with a Stick, String, and a Scorpion Projectile Barb.

**Homing Arrows** are exactly what they sound like.  You shoot it out of a Bow or Crossbow, and it locates nearby hostile entities and players (not including the shooter) and steers itself towards them.  Craft them like an arrow but with a Buzzblade Stinger Barb
instead of Flint and a Buzzblade Wing instead of a Feather

**Juicy Bug Meat** is a new food item.  It is dropped by the mojority of the new mobs, and restores a single hunger point (half a drumstick icon) and practically no saturation.  It also gives you nausea.

You can cook Juicy Bug Meat on a Campfire to obtain **Crispy Bug Meat**.  It takes very little time to consume and restores four hunger points (two drumstick icons).

If you cook Juicy Bug Meat traditionally, like in a furnace or smoker, you will instead get **Charred Bug Meat**. It takes five seconds to consume (because it is so overcooked and tough and nasty) and gives you Hunger I for thirty seconds.

**Exoskeleton Armor** is a new armor set that is between Diamond and Netherite armor in terms of it's defense.  However, each piece of armor you put on decreases the chance that you get hit with a projectile. 
Instead, the projectile gets deflected and flung back where it came from.  It is crafted using Carapace Segemnts (dropped from Burdenbeetles) in the traditional crafting shapes.  Yes, you can use trims on it.
