### Blocks

**Blocks of Juicy Bug Meat** are crafted by nine pieces of Juicy Bug Meat.  They negate all fall damage when you land on them, but give you Nausea and Poison for ten seconds when stood upon.

**Reinforced End Stone** has the properties of Reinforced Deepslate (harder than obsidian) except that it will drop the ingredients used to craft it when mined.  You can create three by putting three End Stone in a line
across the middle of a crafting table and a line of Scorpion Carapace Segments above and below.

You can make **Scorpion Lanterns** by putting an End Rod in the center of a 3x3 crafting grid, putting two Popped Chorus Fruit on the left and right, and filling the remaining empty slots with Scorpion Carapace Segments.
It emits a light level of fifteen and has the toughness of deepslate.  Also, it's purple, and no mod is complete with out a reskinned purple block/item.
